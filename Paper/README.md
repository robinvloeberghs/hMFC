# hMFC: Paper

#### param_recovery_simulations.py
Contains all the code to run the simulations for the parameter recovery and write away the data in .csv and .dil files.

#### param_recovery_plotting.py
Used to create all the plots related to the parameter recovery of hMFC. In order to run this script, all .csv and .dil files have to be loaded in.

The .csv files can be found in the map *"csv files for param recovery plotting"*. The .dil files can be retrieved from https://osf.io/pg4m6/.

This script also generates additional recovery plots for each simulated dataset. The plots can be found in the map *"additional plots parameter recovery"*.

#### correction_three_effects.py
Used to illustrate the relation between criterion fluctuations and sequential effects, d', and the psychometric slope.

Requires to load in .dil files that also can be found at https://osf.io/pg4m6/.
